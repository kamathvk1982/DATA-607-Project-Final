### What is this app?

This is a simple Shiny application created as part of the [_DATA 607, Data Acquisition and Management_] course offered by City University Of New York's (CUNY) Online Masters in Data Science.

The app allows a user to explore president Trump's and Obama’s State of the Union address. Each president’s State of the Union address is an attempt to set the tone for his term in office — what are the administration’s goals, plans and promises? Those questions dominate the 24-hour news cycle around this yearly address to Congress and drives the stock market senitments.

Nearly 50 million people tuned in to watch President Obama’s first State of the Union address External link  in 2010. President Trump’s speech last year generated more than 4.5 million tweets, External link  the most ever for a presidential address.

It’s been more than a century since President Woodrow Wilson’s first State of the Union address, and while the language presidents use to communicate has evolved, many of the words, phrases, and ideas have stood the test of time. 

Comparing those words, over time, is one way to hold presidencies up against each other, to assess the ways in which presidential communication has changed. How can we objectively compare one State of the Union address to another? Data analysis can be used to transform otherwise dry, static information into comparable statistics that show trends across words, presidents, and years.

The data are sourced from the  journeys made using an [Oyster card](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/what-is-oyster), which TfL kindly provide in a weekly file (_.csv_). Long term development plans for this app include the ability for others to upload their own data to see similar results.
